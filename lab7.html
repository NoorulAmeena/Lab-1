<h2>Chapter VI
<span class="chaptertitle">Pig and Pepper</span>
</h2>

<p>For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood&mdash;(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)&mdash;and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> 

<p>The Fish-Footman began by producing
from under his arm a great letter, nearly
as large as himself, and this he handed over
to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, "For
the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
to play croquet." The Frog-Footman repeated,
in the same solemn tone, only
changing the order of the words a little,
"From the Queen. An invitation for the
Duchess to play croquet."</p>

<p>Then they both bowed low, and their curls
got entangled together.</p>



<p>"I shall sit here," the Footman remarked,
"till to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: this closing quotation mark was added to the text">"</ins></p>

<p>At this moment the door of the house
opened, and a large plate came skimming
out, straight at the Footman's head: it just
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against
one of the trees behind him.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;or next day, maybe," the Footman
continued in the same tone, exactly as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"How am I to get in?" asked Alice again
in a louder tone.</p>

<p>"<em>Are</em> you to get in at all?" said the Footman.
"That's the first question, you know."</p>

<p>It was, no doubt: only Alice did not
like to be told so. "It's really dreadful,"
she muttered to herself, "the way all the
creatures argue. It's enough to drive one
crazy!"</p>

<p>The Footman seemed to consider this a
good opportunity for repeating his remark,
with variations. "I shall sit here," he said,
"on and off, for days and days."</p>

<p>"But what am <em>I</em> to do?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Anything you like," said the Footman,
and began whistling.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no use in talking to him,"
said Alice desperately: "he's perfectly
idiotic!" And she opened the door and
went in.</p>

<p>The door led right into a large kitchen,
which was full of smoke from one end to the
other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged
stool in the middle, nursing a baby,
the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a
large cauldron which seemed to be full of
soup.</p>



<p>"It's a Cheshire <ins title="Transcriber's Note: single quotation mark changed to double">cat,"</ins> said the Duchess,
"and that's why. Pig!"</p>

<p>She said the last word with such sudden
violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw
in another moment that it was addressed to
the baby, and not to her, so she took courage,
and went on again:</p>

<p>"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always
grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats <em>could</em>
grin."</p>

<p>"They all can," said the Duchess; "and
most of 'em do."</p>

<p>"I don't know of any that do," Alice said
very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got
into a conversation.</p>

<p>"You don't know much," said the Duchess;
"and that's a fact."</p>


does."</p>

<p>"Which would <em>not</em> be an advantage," said
Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity
of showing off a little of her knowledge.
"Just think what work it would make with
the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its
axis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Talking of axes," said the Duchess, "chop
off her head."</p>

"Speak roughly to your little boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beat him when he sneezes:</span><br />
He only does it to annoy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he knows it teases."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Chorus</span><br />

(In which the cook and the baby joined):<br />
"Wow! wow! wow!"<br />
</div>

<p>While the Duchess sang the second verse of
the song, she kept tossing the baby violently
up and down, and the poor little thing howled
so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I speak severely to my boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I beat him when he sneezes;</span><br />
For he can thoroughly enjoy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pepper when he pleases!"</span><br />
</div><div class='center'><br />
<span class="smcap">Chorus.</span><br />

"Wow! wow! wow!"<br />
</div>

<p>"Here! you may nurse it a bit if you like!"
the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby
at her as she spoke. "I must go and get
ready to play croquet with the Queen," and
she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it
just missed her.</p>

<p>The baby grunted again, and Alice looked
very anxiously into its face to see what was
the matter with it. There could be no doubt
that it had a <em>very</em> turn-up nose, much more
like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes
were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether
Alice did not like the look of the thing
at all. "But perhaps it was only sobbing,"
she thought, and looked into its eyes again,
to see if there were any tears.</p>

<p>The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
It looked good-natured, she thought: still it
had <em>very</em> long claws and a great many teeth,
so she felt that it ought to be treated with
respect.</p>

<p>"Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly,
as she did not at all know whether it would
like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. "Come, it's pleased so far," thought
Alice, and she went on. "Would you tell me,
please, which way I ought to go from here?"</p>

<p>"That depends a good deal on where you
want to get to," said the Cat.</p>

<p>"I don't much care where&mdash;&mdash;" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Then it doesn't matter which way you
go," said the Cat.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; so long as I get <em>somewhere</em>," Alice
added as an explanation.</p>
 said the Cat, and
vanished again.</p>

</figure>

<p>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see
it again, but it did not appear, and after a
minute or two she walked on in the direction
in which the March Hare was said to live.
"I've seen hatters before," she said to herself;
"the March Hare will be much the most
interesting, and perhaps as this is May, it
won't be raving mad&mdash;at least not so mad as
it was in March." As she said this, she
looked up, and there was the Cat again,
sitting on the branch of a tree.</p>


<p>She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself, to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself, "Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!"</p>
